ðŸ“Œ MySQL Terminology Cheat Sheet
Tables
- Table: A structured collection of data, organized into rows and columns.
- Column (Field): A single piece of data, like a name or age, stored in a table.
- Row (Record): A complete set of related data points within a table.
- Primary Key: A unique identifier for each row in a table (e.g., id).
- Foreign Key: A column that links one table to another to maintain relationships.
- Index: A performance booster that speeds up data retrieval operations.
Relational Databases (SQL-based)
- Definition: Structured databases that use tables with defined relationships.
- Characteristics:
- Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
- Relationships are established via primary and foreign keys.
- Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for operations.
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle Database.
Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL-based)
- Definition: Flexible databases that store unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Types:
- Document-based (e.g., MongoDB) â†’ Stores JSON-like documents.
- Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis) â†’ Uses unique keys to retrieve values.
- Column-based (e.g., Apache Cassandra) â†’ Optimized for large-scale data.
- Graph-based (e.g., Neo4j) â†’ Manages complex relationships.
- Characteristics:
- No fixed schema (adaptable structure).
- Scales easily across distributed systems.
- Best suited for big data, caching, and real-time analytics.

Data is raw informationâ€”facts, figures, statistics, or any form of content that can be collected, stored, and analyzed. It can exist in various formats such as text, numbers, images, audio, or video.

Types of Data

- Structured Data: Organized and easily searchable (e.g., data in relational databases like MySQL).
- Unstructured Data: Free-form and harder to analyze (e.g., emails, social media posts, videos).
- Semi-Structured Data: A mix of both, often containing tags or labels (e.g., JSON or XML files).
- Big Data: Large, complex datasets that require specialized processing (e.g., social media trends, IoT sensor readings).
Uses of Data
- Business decisions (analytics and insights)
- Scientific research
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Personal records and storage
